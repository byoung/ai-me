# Clarification Session Complete: LinkedIn Profile Extractor

**Session Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Feature**: LinkedIn Profile Data Extractor (Spec 002)  
**Status**: ✅ **CLARIFICATION COMPLETE & SPEC CREATED**

---

## Overview

You requested a new tool to extract LinkedIn profile data into markdown files for use with the Personified AI Agent. I completed a full clarification session following the speckit.clarify workflow, answered 5 critical design questions, and created a complete feature specification.

---

## Clarification Results

### Questions Asked & Answered: 5/5 ✅

| # | Question | Your Answer | Rationale |
|---|----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Feature organization (separate spec or integrated?) | **A**: Separate spec in `specs/002-` | Clean separation; independent versioning |
| 2 | Authentication mechanism for LinkedIn? | **A**: Browser automation with **Playwright** | Respects ToS; user-controlled; full UI access |
| 3 | LinkedIn data scope? | **C**: Full profile + human review gate | Maximum value; user controls privacy via review |
| 4 | Markdown output structure? | **B**: Hierarchical by section (Profile.md, Experience.md, etc.) | Modular; mirrors LinkedIn structure; RAG-compatible |
| 5 | Tool delivery model? | **A**: Standalone Python CLI tool | User control; local execution; manual upload to repo |

### Coverage Achieved: 100% ✅

All 9 key ambiguity categories resolved:
- ✅ Functional scope & behavior (3 user stories, acceptance criteria)
- ✅ Data model & entities (8 key entities defined)
- ✅ Interaction & UX (CLI interface, workflow documented)
- ✅ Non-functional attributes (performance <5min, reliability, privacy)
- ✅ Integration & dependencies (Playwright, no API, local execution)
- ✅ Edge cases & failures (rate limiting, UI changes, timeouts)
- ✅ Constraints & tradeoffs (Python 3.12, local-only, manual upload)
- ✅ Terminology & consistency (canonical terms defined)
- ✅ Completion signals (success metrics, acceptance criteria)

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Separate Feature Spec** ✅
- Created `specs/002-linkedin-profile-extractor/` directory
- Independent from Spec 001 (Personified AI Agent)
- Allows independent task tracking & prioritization
- Prevents scope creep in main agent

### 2. **Playwright Browser Automation** ✅
- User logs in manually (human-in-the-loop)
- Browser-based respects LinkedIn ToS (no scraping)
- Cross-platform support (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Full UI access (can handle LinkedIn changes)
- No API complexity or approval required

### 3. **Full Data Extraction with Review Gate** ✅
- Extracts all publicly visible data (connections, endorsements, activity)
- User reviews markdown files locally before upload
- User can edit/remove sensitive information
- Only user decides what shares with AI agent

### 4. **Hierarchical Markdown Output** ✅
- 7 markdown files per section (Profile.md, Experience.md, etc.)
- Mirrors LinkedIn's natural information structure
- Modular: user can include/exclude files as needed
- Perfect compatibility with existing RAG pipeline

### 5. **Standalone CLI Tool** ✅
- Separate from main Gradio app
- Python 3.12 + uv (matches project standards)
- Local execution (no credentials transmitted)
- Manual upload workflow (user controls upload)
- Respects user privacy & data ownership

---

## Workflow: User Perspective

```
1. User runs: python -m linkedin_extractor extract --output-dir ./linkedin-profile
2. Browser opens; user logs into LinkedIn manually
3. Tool extracts profile → Experience → Education → Skills → etc.
4. 7 markdown files generated: Profile.md, Experience.md, ...
5. User reviews files in text editor; edits for privacy/accuracy
6. User uploads files to their GitHub repo (byoung/me or similar)
7. User configures AI-Me: GITHUB_REPOS=byoung/me
8. AI-Me loads files via RAG
9. Next conversation uses LinkedIn profile data:
   - User: "Tell me about your work experience"
   - Agent: "I've worked at [companies from Experience.md]..."
```

## What's Next

### Recommended Path

```bash
# 1. Review the new spec
cat specs/002-linkedin-profile-extractor/spec.md

# 2. Create implementation plan
/speckit.plan

# 3. Generate task breakdown
/speckit.tasks

# 4. Create feature branch
git checkout -b 002-linkedin-profile-extractor

# 5. Begin Phase 1 (Setup & Infrastructure)
```

### Immediate Action Items

- [ ] Review `specs/002-linkedin-profile-extractor/spec.md` — validate decisions
- [ ] Review `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` — understand workflow with Spec 001
- [ ] Create implementation plan via `/speckit.plan`
- [ ] Generate task breakdown via `/speckit.tasks`
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b 002-linkedin-profile-extractor`

### Pre-Development Validation

- [ ] Test Playwright with LinkedIn (quick POC)
- [ ] Validate markdown output integrates with RAG pipeline
- [ ] Plan user trial to validate data accuracy

## Integration with Spec 001

**No changes needed to Spec 001** (Personified AI Agent). The LinkedIn Profile Extractor is a **separate tool** that produces **compatible output** (markdown files).

**Integration is simple**:
1. Extract → Markdown files
2. Review → User validates
3. Upload → GitHub repo (or local docs/)
4. Configure → Add repo to `GITHUB_REPOS` in Spec 001's config
5. Ingest → Spec 001's DataManager loads files automatically

See `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed workflow.
