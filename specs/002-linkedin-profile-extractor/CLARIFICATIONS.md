# Clarification Session Report: LinkedIn Profile Extractor Tool

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Feature**: LinkedIn Profile Data Extractor (Spec 002)  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Executive Summary

Clarification session completed with **5 critical questions answered**. All high-impact ambiguities resolved. New feature spec created (`specs/002-linkedin-profile-extractor/spec.md`) with clear design decisions and ready for planning phase.

---

## Questions Asked & Answered

### Question 1: Feature Scope & Organization
**Answer**: A — Create separate spec (`specs/002-linkedin-profile-extractor/spec.md`)

**Rationale**: Cleanly separates concerns from main Personified AI Agent (spec 001), allows independent versioning and task tracking, prevents scope creep.

---

### Question 2: Authentication Mechanism
**Answer**: A with Playwright — Browser automation with manual LinkedIn login

**Rationale**: Respects LinkedIn ToS, gives users full control, avoids API restrictions, captures full LinkedIn UI experience. Playwright chosen for cross-platform support and reliability.

---

### Question 3: Data Extraction Scope
**Answer**: C — Full profile extraction (connections, endorsements, activity) with human review gate

**Context**: User clarified that human review allows verification of privacy/legal concerns, and all extracted data is publicly available anyway.

**Rationale**: Maximum value; human review ensures accuracy and compliance. Users decide what to share with AI agent.

---

### Question 4: Markdown Output Structure
**Answer**: B — Hierarchical markdown by section (Profile.md, Experience.md, Education.md, Skills.md, Recommendations.md, Connections.md, Activity.md)

**Rationale**: Mirrors LinkedIn's natural information architecture, modular for easy editing/exclusion, integrates seamlessly with existing RAG pipeline.

---

### Question 5: Tool Delivery & Integration
**Answer**: A — Standalone Python CLI tool; users run locally, review output, manually upload

**Rationale**: Full user control over data, respects privacy, simple integration with existing workflow, avoids complicating main app deployment.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 0-1)

1. **Review Spec**: Validate spec decisions align with your vision
2. **Data Model Refinement**: Create detailed markdown schema examples (if needed)
3. **Implementation Plan**: Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation roadmap
4. **Task Breakdown**: Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate concrete development tasks

### Pre-Development Verification

1. **Test Playwright with LinkedIn**: Quick POC to verify Playwright can navigate LinkedIn without blocking
2. **Validate Markdown Structure**: Ensure generated markdown integrates with existing RAG pipeline
3. **User Testing Plan**: Plan 1-2 user trials to validate data accuracy and workflow

### Execution Phases

- **Phase 1** (Setup & Infrastructure): Playwright environment, CLI scaffolding, output directory management
- **Phase 2** (Foundational): Core extraction logic, error handling, markdown generation
- **Phase 3** (User Story 1): Profile extraction workflow, testing
- **Phase 4** (User Story 2): Review & validation features
- **Phase 5** (User Story 3): Documentation for upload workflow

## Outstanding Items (None)

All critical ambiguities resolved. No outstanding blocking decisions.

**Deferred to Planning Phase** (as appropriate):
- Specific Playwright selector strategy (implementation detail)
- Error retry logic specifics (implementation detail)
- CLI argument parsing details (implementation detail)

## Suggested Next Command

```bash
# After reviewing spec:
/speckit.plan  # Create detailed implementation roadmap

# Then:
/speckit.tasks  # Generate task breakdown for development
```
