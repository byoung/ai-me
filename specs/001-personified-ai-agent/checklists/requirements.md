# Specification Quality Checklist: Personified AI Agent

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Updated**: 2025-10-23 (post-clarification)  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] Clarifications section added with all resolved ambiguities

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (including tool integration scenarios)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Tool integration requirements explicit and testable
- [x] Conflict resolution strategy defined

## Validation Results

✅ **All items pass** - Specification is complete, clarified, and ready for `/speckit.plan`

### Clarification Summary

**5 questions asked and answered:**
1. Knowledge base configuration → Admin-configurable markdown in GitHub
2. External tool integration → Time & Memory mandatory; GitHub & LinkedIn conditional
3. Conflicting documentation → Prioritize by search score; log for review
4. Tool failure handling → User-friendly errors; halt until recovery
5. Memory scope → Session-scoped user attributes; resets between sessions

### Updated Sections

- ✅ Added Clarifications section with all Q&A
- ✅ Updated Functional Requirements (FR-009 through FR-013 added for tools)
- ✅ Updated Key Entities (added ToolConfiguration, UserAttributes, ConflictLog)
- ✅ Added Tool Integration & Failure Handling subsection
- ✅ Updated Success Criteria (SC-007, SC-008 added for tool resilience & memory)
- ✅ Updated Assumptions (8 items covering all clarified areas)

### Notes

Specification now includes:
- Explicit tool integration strategy with conditional activation
- Clear failure handling and user-friendly error messaging
- Conflict resolution process for contradictory documentation
- Session-scoped memory model for user personalization
- All 13 functional requirements (vs 8 before clarification)
- 8 measurable success criteria (vs 6 before)
- 8 detailed assumptions (vs 5 before)

**Ready to proceed**: `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation strategy
