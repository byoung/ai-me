# Feature Specification: Personified AI Agent

**Feature Branch**: `001-personified-ai-agent`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "An AI Agent that represents a real persons knowledge, experience, and philosophies. Users can interact with the agent in a chat interface that responds with information that is applicable to the person the agent is personifying."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-23

- Q: How should knowledge base documents be configured? → A: Flexible, admin-configurable markdown files stored in a public GitHub repository
- Q: Are external tools (GitHub, LinkedIn, Memory, Time) mandatory or optional? → A: Time and Memory are mandatory/always-on. GitHub and LinkedIn activate conditionally based on environment credentials (GitHub PAT, LinkedIn API token)
- Q: How should conflicting documentation be handled? → A: Prioritize by vector search relevance score; log conflicts for human review post-session
- Q: What happens when external tools fail? → A: Return user-friendly error messages; no partial answers until tools recover
- Q: What should the Memory tool remember and for how long? → A: Session-scoped only; tracks user attributes (name, profession, interests, hobbies) to personalize responses; resets between sessions

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Chat with Personified Agent About Expertise (Priority: P1)

A user opens the chat interface and asks the personified AI agent a question about the person's professional knowledge, projects, or experience. The agent responds with accurate information that sounds like it comes from the person themselves, using first-person perspective and maintaining the person's authentic voice and philosophies.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition—users must be able to have conversations with an agent that authentically represents a real person's expertise. Without this, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the chat interface, asking a question about the person's expertise, and verifying the response is accurate, uses first-person perspective, and reflects the person's knowledge.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the chat interface, **When** they ask "What is your experience with [relevant topic]?", **Then** the agent responds with factual information about the person's background in first-person perspective
2. **Given** the agent has access to documentation about the person's work, **When** a user asks about a project, **Then** the agent retrieves and summarizes the relevant project details accurately
3. **Given** a user asks about the person's philosophy or approach, **When** the agent responds, **Then** the response reflects the documented philosophies and maintains authentic voice

---

### User Story 2 - Interact Across Multiple Conversation Topics (Priority: P2)

A user has multiple conversations with the agent across different topics (e.g., professional questions, personal philosophies, project specifics). Each conversation maintains context about the person's identity and answers are consistent across topics.

**Why this priority**: Users need to be able to explore different aspects of the person's knowledge in a single session without losing the sense that they're talking to one consistent person. This enables deeper engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a conversation, asking questions on different topics, and verifying the agent maintains persona consistency and provides topic-appropriate, contextually accurate responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user asks about multiple different topics, **When** the agent responds to each question, **Then** all responses use consistent first-person perspective and reflect the same person's identity
2. **Given** a user asks follow-up questions, **When** the agent responds, **Then** it maintains awareness of previous messages in the conversation
3. **Given** a user asks questions outside the documented knowledge, **When** the agent responds, **Then** it gracefully indicates gaps in its knowledge while staying in character

---

### User Story 3 - Access Sourced Information with Attribution (Priority: P2)

A user asks the agent a question, and the agent provides a response with clear references to where the information came from (e.g., "As mentioned in my project documentation..." or "Per my resume..."). Users can understand the credibility and source of the agent's responses.

**Why this priority**: Transparency about information sources builds trust. Users need to know whether the agent is drawing from documented facts versus making inferences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by asking questions that should reference documented sources and verifying the agent provides source attribution for factual claims.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user asks about the person's background, **When** the agent responds, **Then** it references specific documents or sections where this information comes from
2. **Given** the agent uses information from multiple sources, **When** it responds, **Then** it appropriately attributes different points to their sources
3. **Given** a user asks for clarification on a source, **When** they request it, **Then** the agent can identify which documentation supports its answer

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user asks a question that cannot be answered from the documented knowledge base?
- How does the system handle questions that might misrepresent the person's views (e.g., "You must believe X...")? 
- What happens if the person's documented views seem to contradict each other on a topic?
- How does the agent handle requests for information about the person that isn't documented (e.g., personal details)?
- What occurs if the documentation about the person is incomplete for a specific topic the user asks about?

### Tool Integration & Failure Handling

- When Time or Memory tools become unavailable, system returns user-friendly error and halts processing until tool recovers
- When optional tools (GitHub, LinkedIn) are unavailable, system gracefully degrades—they remain inactive until credentials are provided
- When documentation conflicts exist, system logs the conflict (including vector search scores) for human review; agent uses highest-scoring source in response
- When GitHub repository access fails (invalid PAT, rate limit, network error), system returns friendly error message; processing resumes when connectivity/credentials restored
- When Memory tool detects new user attributes not previously tracked in session, it persists them for duration of session only

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a chat interface where users can send messages and receive responses
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve relevant information from the person's knowledge base (admin-configurable markdown files in a public GitHub repository) based on user queries
- **FR-003**: System MUST respond in first-person perspective, maintaining the persona of the person being represented
- **FR-004**: System MUST reference sources for factual claims (e.g., "per my documentation on X")
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain conversation history within a single session
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle cases where the knowledge base doesn't contain an answer by gracefully indicating knowledge gaps
- **FR-007**: System MUST support conversation threads/sessions isolated from other users
- **FR-008**: System MUST normalize and clean output to ensure consistent, readable responses across platforms
- **FR-009**: System MUST include mandatory tools: Time (current date/time) and Memory (session-scoped user attribute tracking)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support optional tools: GitHub (activated if GitHub PAT environment variable set) and LinkedIn (activated if LinkedIn API token environment variable set)
- **FR-011**: System MUST prioritize conflicting documentation by vector search relevance score and log conflicts for human review
- **FR-012**: When external tools fail or become unavailable, system MUST return a user-friendly error message and wait for tool recovery before processing further queries
- **FR-013**: Memory tool MUST track session-scoped user attributes (name, profession, interests, hobbies) to personalize responses; memory resets between sessions

### Key Entities

- **PersonProfile**: Represents the person the agent embodies (name, background, documented knowledge, philosophies, areas of expertise)
- **ConversationSession**: Represents an individual user's conversation instance with metadata (session ID, timestamps, message history, session-scoped memory)
- **Message**: User input or agent response within a conversation (content, timestamp, role, source attribution if applicable)
- **KnowledgeBase**: Collection of admin-configured markdown documentation about the person, sourced from a public GitHub repository (projects, resume, philosophies, experience, etc.)
- **RetrievedDocument**: Individual chunks of documentation retrieved during query processing (content, source, relevance score)
- **ToolConfiguration**: Defines which tools are active for an agent instance (Time: always on, Memory: always on, GitHub: conditional on GitHub PAT, LinkedIn: conditional on LinkedIn API token)
- **UserAttributes**: Session-scoped data tracked by Memory tool (name, profession, interests, hobbies) for personalizing responses within a session
- **ConflictLog**: Records instances where documentation contradicts itself, prioritized by vector search score, flagged for human review

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users perceive responses as authentically representing the person's voice and perspective (test cases + selective sampling of logs show less than 10% false +/- rate)
- **SC-002**: Responses are factually accurate and sourced from the person's documentation (100% of sample responses contain only information present in knowledge base)
- **SC-003**: Users receive answers to their questions on topics covered in the documentation (90% of in-scope questions receive substantive responses)
- **SC-004**: System correctly handles knowledge gaps by indicating them to users (100% of out-of-scope questions receive explicit "I don't have documentation on that" acknowledgment)
- **SC-005**: Conversation can be completed in natural timeframe with responsive interaction (agent responds to user queries in under 5 seconds)
- **SC-006**: Multiple simultaneous users can interact with the agent without interference (10+ concurrent conversations function independently)
- **SC-007**: Tool failures are handled gracefully with user-friendly error messages (100% of tool failures result in appropriate error messaging, not crashes)
- **SC-008**: Session-scoped memory improves personalization within a conversation (users report agent responses feel more tailored as conversation progresses)

### Assumptions

- The person's knowledge and philosophies are documented in markdown files stored in a public GitHub repository (admin-configurable per agent instance)
- Users are familiar with chat interfaces and understand they're interacting with an AI agent
- The documentation is reasonably comprehensive for the domains the agent will be questioned about
- Users accept some inconsistencies if documentation is incomplete or contradictory (system logs conflicts for human review)
- The agent should prioritize accuracy over engagement (never fabricate information to be more responsive)
- Time tool (current date/time) and Memory tool (session-scoped user attributes) are always available in the operating environment
- GitHub PAT and LinkedIn API tokens, if provided, will be available as environment variables; tools remain inactive without credentials
- Users are comfortable with session-scoped memory (attributes not persisted across separate sessions without explicit opt-in mechanism)
